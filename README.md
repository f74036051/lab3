compile: make

question b
1.const int size=100000
sort():0.04
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():127.78 seconds
v1/v2 are the same

2.const int size=1000
sort():0
v1/v2 are different
insertion_sort():0 seconds
v1/v2 are the same

3.const int size=10000
sort(): 0 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 1.27 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

4.const int size=100000
sort(): 0.51 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 12843.76 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

the difference between O(n log n) and O(n2) is the time
take the fourth one for example
the sort time is 6*10^6
while the other is 10^6^2=10^12
when divide them we will get the value =10^5
